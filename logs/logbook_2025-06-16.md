## 🎯 Goal

Begin development of the Street Vendor Demand Predictor (SVDP) with the core four-layer architecture: Input → State → Task → Output.

## ✅ What Was Done

* Designed initial file structure for modular development.
* Implemented `agent.py` with:

  * Enum classes for Weather and Location
  * Dataclasses for VendorProfile, DayContext, PredictionOutput
  * Methods for input processing, state tracking, task execution, and output formatting
* Populated `memory.json` with 3 real-world vendor profiles and historical sales data.
* Added contextual patterns in `memory.json` such as:

  * Festival and weekend boosts
  * Rain and heat reduction effects
  * Item-specific demand trends
* Wrote `terminal_ui.py` to:

  * Allow vendor selection from memory
  * Accept real-world day context input
  * Trigger predictions and display results

## 🔍 Issues Faced

* JSON field normalization for enums like `LocationType` required explicit conversion.
* Confidence scoring logic needed bounding to ensure predictable UI messages.

## 💡 Breakthroughs

* Learned that allowing `memory.json` to evolve over time improves prediction quality.
* Built a consistent interface between `terminal_ui.py` and `agent.py` using shared dataclasses.

## ✏️ Sample Run Output
